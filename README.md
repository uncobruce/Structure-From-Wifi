# Structure from WiFi (SfM)
K Means Clustering: An implementation of the paper [An RSSI-based Wall Prediction Model For Residential Floor Map Construction](https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~xf14883/files/conf/2015_wfiot_wall.pdf) (2015). Obtains thresholds of RSSI values that provide limits for how many rooms are between sensor and a WiFi access point. 

k_visibility.py: Implementation of the paper [A Hybrid Metaheuristic Strategy for Covering with Wireless Devices](http://www.jucs.org/jucs_18_14/a_hybrid_metaheuristic_strategy/jucs_18_14_1906_1932_bajuelos.pdf)  (2012). Constructs k-visibility regions of a given map.
